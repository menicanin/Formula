# shiftRegistersAndLeds
This repository contains an Arduino program that controls a shift register to drive 11 LEDs. The program uses the ledFx library to create modern turn signal animations, where the lights appear to “run” or “fill” in the direction of the turn. Create custom lighting effects and add modern style to your project with this program.
